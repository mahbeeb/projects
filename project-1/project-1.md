# Hators Corp Cloud Infrastructure Design

## Scenario Overview

**Company:** Hators Corp, a pioneering startup in the healthcare industry.

**Objective:** Design a robust Cloud Infrastructure solution to host various application workloads.

**Documentation:** Create an architectural diagram for each section of the implementation, and also document the reason for your solution choice stating why you recommended the solution and how it will help the organization utilize the capabilities of the cloud.

**Key Cloud Priorities:**
1. High Availability
2. Autoscaling
3. Security

## Specific Requirements & Proposed Solutions

### 1. Web Application - "MediConnect"

#### Purpose
A user-facing web application to provide healthcare services and information.

#### Cloud Features
- **Load Balancing:** Ensures even distribution of traffic and high availability.
- **Auto-Scaling Groups:** Dynamically adjusts the number of instances in response to traffic demands.
- **SSL/TLS Encryption:** For secure data transmission.
- **DDoS Protection:** To safeguard against external threats.

#### Deployment
Container deployment or direct code deployment using PaaS solution for easy scaling and management.

### 2. Storage Solution for Unstructured Data - "HealthVault"

#### Purpose
To store a wide range of unstructured data like patient records, medical images, and research data.

#### Cloud Features
- **Object Storage:** For scalable and secure data storage.
- **Data Encryption:** Both at rest and in transit.
- **Data Lifecycle Management:** For efficient data handling and cost management.

### 3. Virtual Desktops (Bastion) for Developers - "CodeHealth Workspace"

#### Purpose
Provide developers with secure, scalable, and customizable virtual desktop environments to access the private network.

#### Cloud Features
- **Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI):** Solution a Virtual Desktop environment using an IAAS implementation.
- **Secure Access:** Integration with identity management solutions such as Azure Entra ID for secure access.
- **Resource Scaling:** Depending on developer needs and project demands.

### 4. Cost-Saving Deployment Model for API - "HealthAPI"

#### Scenario
Initially low utilization expected.

#### Proposed Solution
- **Serverless Architecture:** Cost-effective as you pay only for the compute time you consume.
- **Usage Plans:** To keep track of and limit usage in the initial phase to control costs.

## Additional Considerations

- **Compliance and Regulations:** Ensuring that all solutions comply with healthcare industry standards like HIPAA. Utilize a governance model to enure compliance.
- **Disaster Recovery Plan:** Implementing a robust strategy for data backup and recovery.
- **Monitoring and Logging:** Utilize cloud monitoring tools for real-time tracking of application performance and security.
- **Cost Optimization:** Regular reviews of cloud resource usage to optimize and reduce costs where possible.
